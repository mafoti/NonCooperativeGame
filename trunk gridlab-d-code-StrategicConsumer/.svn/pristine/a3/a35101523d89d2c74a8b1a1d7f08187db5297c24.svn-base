# This benchmark test create 1000 commercial buildings
# with no objects inside them.  It plays a simple 6 hr
# weather tape that is not connected.  The result
# should be a test of the system ability to exploit
# the implicit parallelism of the model.  The more
# processors are used, the faster the simulation 
# should run.
