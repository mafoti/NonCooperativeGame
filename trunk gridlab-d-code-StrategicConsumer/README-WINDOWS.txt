Getting Started with GridLAB-D 

1) Before running GridLAB-D, ensure that the GLPATH system variable was created
during installation. The GLPATH variable should point to the folder containing
the GridLAB-D libraries and support files: 
<installPath>lib
<installPath>etc 

After installation, the location of the GridLAB-D executable should also have
been added to the PATH system variable.
<installPath>bin

2) GridLAB-D is run as a console application. To view all command-line
parameters, open a command window and type the following command. 
"gridlabd.exe -h"

You can access a command window from the Start Menu:
Start->Programs->GridLAB-D->GridLAB-D Console
