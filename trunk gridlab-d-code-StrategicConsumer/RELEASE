RELEASE INFO
============

$Id$
Copyright (C) 2008 Battelle Memorial Institute

This document describes how to release a build source of GridLAB-D.
This only applies to systems that support autoconf.  Windows builds
are released by a different method not documented here.

Step 1 - Mark all folders for release
-------------------------------------

This is done by creating three files in each folder that are used to detect
whether the contents of the folder is to be release.  These are

	COPYRIGHT	This file must contain the copyright information of the
	         	original author.
	LICENSE		This file must contain the license granted to user's by
	        	the original copyright author.
	STATUS  	This file contains general status information

Step 2 - Run the release script
-------------------------------

The release script is in the utilities folder. It should be run from the
folder that will be the base of release, e.g.:

	linux% cd source
	linux% utilities/release-src

The resulting tar.gz file will be written to the parent folder.

Step 3 - Publish the tar.gz file
--------------------------------

This file can be distributed freely in compliance with the terms of the
GridLAB-D license.

Step 4 - Update the version number
----------------------------------

After a release is published, the version number should be updated.  Generally
only the minor number is incremented.  The major number is only incremented if
there is a significant core imcompatibility that makes modules and/or data
files misbehave when working with the previous version.  To increment the
MINOR version you must do the following

	linux% cd <source-folder>
	linux% utilities/increment_version --commit NAME

where NAME is the code name of the next release (see core/legal.c for a list
of names).
	
To increment the MAJOR version, do the following

	linux% cd <source-folder>
	linux% utilities/increment_version --major --commit NAME

Don't forget to update core/legal.c with the release number and name in the
VERSION file once it is incremented.
