%description
GridLAB-D™ is a new power distribution system simulation and analysis tool
that provides valuable information to users who design and operate
distribution systems, and to utilities that wish to take advantage of the
latest energy technologies. It incorporates the most advanced modeling
techniques, with high-performance algorithms to deliver the best in end-use
modeling. GridLAB-D™ is coupled with distribution automation models and
software integration tools for users of many power system analysis tools.

GridLAB-D™ was developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) at Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), in collaboration with industry and
academia.
